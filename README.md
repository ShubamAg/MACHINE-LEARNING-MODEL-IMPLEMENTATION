##Task Discription 

For the final task, I implemented a spam detection model using scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook. I used the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains labeled text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

Steps involved:

Reading and preprocessing the dataset (cleaning text, removing punctuation, etc.).

Converting text into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Training a Naive Bayes classifier to learn patterns in spam messages.

Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

The notebook includes visualizations for word frequencies and performance metrics. The model achieved high accuracy and can classify unseen messages with good precision.

Skills gained:

End-to-end ML pipeline creation.

Preprocessing and feature engineering for text data.

Understanding model evaluation techniques.

Using scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib in a cohesive workflow.
